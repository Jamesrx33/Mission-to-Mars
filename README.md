## Overview
This application is designed to display Mars news, photos and facts obtained using a Bootstrap 3 button in a custom Flask webpage. This button initializes a web scrape of multiple Mars-Related sites. The HTML from these sites is parsed and processed to obtain recent articles, tables and picures pertaining to the Planet Mars. This parsed data is then stored in a local MongoDB server and extracted to update our Flask web app with the most recent information about Mars.
